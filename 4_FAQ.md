# Frequently Asked Questions 

* Will the list of participants be added here https://github.com/canada-ca/OS-Advisory_Conseil-SO/blob/master/Meeting_March_15.md ?

* Why are we looking for a business case for open source software rather than for proprietary software?

* Is there alignment with the Open Source Advisory Board and the Canadian Digital Service?

* How do we get government to stop building new custom initiatives (code or policy) and start re-using and refining other initiatives?

* What is being done to shift the culture within the government?

* Is there an example of government specific licensing actually promoting adoption and collaboration? MIT, BSD, GPL… not Crown
Copyright

* Is PSC using OpenShift?
  * Yes, we evaluated Open Shift and Cloud Foundry two years ago and landed on Open Shift. Our severs were prepared a few months ago by ssc and we're now tweaking the configuration before undertaking the SA&À. Rachid is the manager leading this innovative project.

* Is the scope just using open source software or does it include a push to use  modern software development processes like automated ci, and deploying daily?  

* Should we create a slack group? No, it’s closed software other suggestions include: GCMessage, Riot, Github

* The province of BC pushes code to public repositories, why can’t the federal government?

* Will you be looking for SMEs to support you in your various initiatives? How can we get involved as an advisor in best practices to
participate in the conversations; development frameworks, development practices, CCC solutions, AI & Intelligent assistant?

* Is there an option to create some sort of actual online community? I'm assuming Slack isn't available to all GC staff and GS
internal tools aren't available to those of us on the outside.
  * Yes there is, just recently the new IM service Rocket.Chat is up and ready at https://message.gccollab.ca/. You can sign in with your GCcollab account and join the #opensourcesoftware channel.
