# DRAFT Terms of reference

## Preamble

On December 14, 2017 the Government of Canada Enterprise Architecture Review Board made a decision to “use open source tools as key components of its technology eco-system” and “support the creation and adoption of open source throughout their practice, resulting in a robust open community within the GC.”

As such, the Secretary of the Treasury Board of Canada established the Government of **Canada Chief Technology Officer Open Source Advisory Board (CTO-OSAB)** as a forum for discussion of the sustainable adoption of open source across the government.

## Background

The CTO-OSAB aims to leverage the knowledge of internal and external subject matter experts to provide advice to senior technology leaders across the GC on the most effective approach to implementing an integrated eco-system of open source
and closed source technology.

Given that the adoption of open source tools is new across the GC, establishing a forum for dialogue provides a formal structure for regular, two-way communication between the Government and its key open source stakeholders. This process is designed to achieve real gains in transparency, accountability, and participation, while supporting the adoption of the right tools at the right time.

## Effective Date

February 15, 2018

## Operations

_Governance_

The CTO-OSAB is responsible for providing advice to the GC Enterprise Architecture Review Board (GC EARB) on open source projects, open standards, procurement of open source tools, and practices for implementing a more open
culture.

The advisory board will be co-chaired by the GC CTO and a private sector executive dedicated to the evolution of open source tools within Canada.

General membership will be limited to a maximum of twenty-four members to ensure the most productive discussion possible. Twelve spaces will be provided for both GC and non-GC members. Non-GC members can consist of industry, civil society, academic, and government representatives.

Application for general membership will be submitted to and determined by co-chairs. There will be a one-year term limit for both general membership and the industry co-chair. The GC CTO, or pre-determined delegate will be made available on an on-going basis for this advisory board.

All meetings will be open for anyone to attend. All resources will be
shared through GitHub which is open to non-GC members.

_Frequency_

The CTO-OSAB meets the third Wednesday of every month, with the option for the committee to meet more frequently as required.

_Working groups_

Domain specific working groups will be established on an as needed basis to manage the effective operation of open source tools within the government. Each working group consists of a lead responsible for reporting back to the CTO-OSAB on a quarterly basis through a written and/ or verbal report. All reports will be made publicly available.

_Location_

Unless otherwise agreed, the room for in-person participation is in Ottawa.

_Participation_
