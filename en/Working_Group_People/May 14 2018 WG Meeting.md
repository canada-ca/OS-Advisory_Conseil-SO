# People - Open Source Advisory Board - introductory meeting

https://github.com/canada-ca/OS-Advisory_Conseil-SO/blob/master/en/Working_Group_People/People.md

### Participants
* Richard - RedHat - Create open and collaborative environment - lots of info to share
* Harsh - GitHub - Help OSS and business communities collaborate -
* Shermineh - Blockchain, AI & OSS - Cyrus - startups -
* Chris
* Erin RobotGrrl - develop OSS robots to improve environment - understanding OSS from youth perspective
* Guillaume - supporting OSS in advisory board

### Objectives
Our goals will be to addressing challenges or opportunities related to engaging people and partnerships in open source, including, but not limited to:
* Community -- need to define. If inside, then what kind of communities are we talking about? Domain specific?
* Broader open source community - (Projects might be outside of government on their own time)
* Are developers encouraged to participate in communities? Demographics and future retirement?
* Youth, recruiting and retention
* Inclusiveness, diversity
* External outreach activites (eg, hackathons, education)
* Working / procurement / contracts / collaboration and the Gov/external OSS community
* How do organizations that need to work with external do so?
* Benefits to business?
* Professional services, etc.
* Benefits for the Business, the organization
* Culture
* Inviting
* Transparent
* High trust
* Meritocracy - participate, agreee/disagree, best ideas up to the top
* Equality
* Giving recognition
* Work / life balance / Mental Health (core committers / core devs) (anonymization?)
* Future of work
* Fear of working in the open - criticism (coming from working small and closed)
* Give them a platform - allow them to share on their own terms
* Open Source in other business / innovation -- collaboration, feedback loops
* Developer retention - demographics, retirement, recruitment, after retirement action
* Career development, career opportunities - how do we encourage people to join in and take part
* OS Skills broaden opportunities (tools, methodology)
* Ask for contributions in OS == value?
* Change hiring processes in GC? Outside?
* RedHat - recruitment - always looks at open source
* Have contributed code used "in real life" / real scenarios, (eg, for a real purpose, instead of video games)
* Idea: Maybe have a certificate for youth who contribute code? - open badges? Yes! Badges! 🆒
* Program like Google Summer of Code, but GC version!
* Be paired with a code mentor in GC or in industry (eg, from this advisory group)
* Development methodology (skills)
* Re-skilling - big topic
* Continuous learning - baked into job and everyday actions
* Online learning
* Mentoring, Social Media, LinkedIn (build brand, learn new skills, learn new ideas) - also core contributors
* Open Learning - blogs, stack overflow, code academy, Kaggle, YouTube,
* Learning paths - moving from zero to being a core contributor (OS guide - ben balter, GitHub)
* Meet-ups
* Organization
* Education - don't even look at educaton anymore (GItHub) - expert in Ottawa
* Look at work, not education
* ^ How might we make this possible for those who are not as privileged? -- great point.

### What does success look like?
* Take benchmark (list of large departments & bring back OSS Projects that do similar work) - create interest
* Gap in getting people to communicate / know where to look and what to look for -- awareness
* Industry / Domain / Community / Discipline

### Roles

* Increase awareness
* Increase diversity & inclusiveness
* Increase activity in and around OS
* Increase collaboration (developers / consumers) -- connections & relationships
* Increase communication
* Increase transparency (multi-levels)
* Increase recognition

### How we work
* Vendor agnostic

For the initial meeting, I’ve proposed a loose agenda around us coming together as a group and understanding each other’s unique perspectives. If you have any feedback or would like to add a specific topic, please let me know.
Draft Agenda:
·         Round table introductions
·         Brain-storming session on issues re: people & open source
·         Issue prioritization (dot-voting exercise)
·         Round table and closing comments
