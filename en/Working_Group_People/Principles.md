# Principles

* Inclusiveness, diversity
* Inviting - Can you clarify?
* Transparent - Might want to have a more detailed label in order to provide clarify. Maybe "Working in the open" 
* High trust - What is meant by this? High trust of the code and contributor?
* Equality - Can you clarify?
* Meritocracy - participate, agree/disagree, best ideas up to the top
* Work / life balance / Mental Health (core committers / core devs) (anonymization?)
* Make this possible for those who are not as privileged.
* Community involvement: The Open Source community heavilily relies on various forms of contributions. For example, financial donations, contribution of code, and recognition are some major success drivers. 
  * Donations: Yes, the code may be free however in order to receive better support and code improvements, some developers rely on donations as an incentive.
  * Contribution of code (giving back). It's important to give back to the community and to the eco-system. We can improve/share code,  provide feedback in order to ultimately build better and more secure software. It's important to note that our contributions need to be leveraged by all industries and not only the GC.
  * Recognition. Recognizing core contributors on social media or other channels is key to the success of the open source community. A simple shoutout to contributors will go a long way and will undoubtedly motivate them to continue building better code.
