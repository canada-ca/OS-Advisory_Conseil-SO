# Objectives

Our goals will be to addressing challenges or opportunities related to engaging people and partnerships in open source, including, but not limited to:

* Community -- *need to define. If inside, then what kind of communities are we talking about? Domain specific?*
  * Broader open source community - (Projects might be outside of government on their own time)
  * Are developers encouraged to participate in communities? Demographics and future retirement?
* Youth, recruiting and retention
  * Developer retention - demographics, retirement, recruitment, after retirement action
  * Change hiring processes in GC? Outside?
  * RedHat - recruitment - always looks at open source
  * Have contributed code used "in real life" / real scenarios, (eg, for a real purpose, instead of video games)
  * Education - don't even look at education anymore (GItHub) - expert in Ottawa
  * Look at work, not education
* Career development, career opportunities - how do we encourage people to join in and take part
  * OS Skills broaden opportunities (tools, methodology)
  * Giving recognition
  * Idea: Maybe have a certificate for youth who contribute code? - open badges? Yes! Badges! ðŸ†’
  * Development methodology (skills)
* Re-skilling - big topic
  * Continuous learning - baked into job and everyday actions
  * Online learning
  * Mentoring, Social Media, LinkedIn (build brand, learn new skills, learn new ideas) - also core contributors
  * Open Learning - blogs, stack overflow, code academy, Kaggle, YouTube,
  * Learning paths - moving from zero to being a core contributor (OS guide - ben balter, GitHub)
* Culture
  * Fear of working in the open - criticism (coming from working small and closed)
  * Mentality Change/mindset shift
* Organization
  * Benefits for the Business, the organization
  * Give them a platform - allow them to share on their own terms
  * Ask for contributions in OS == value?
* Private industry
  * Professional services, etc.
  * Benefits to business, private companies?
  * How do organizations that need to work with external do so?
  * Working / procurement / contracts / collaboration and the Gov/external OSS community
  * Future of work
  * Open Source in other business / innovation -- collaboration, feedback loops
* External outreach activities (eg, hackathons, education)
  * Program like Google Summer of Code, but GC version!
  * Be paired with a code mentor in GC or in industry (eg, from this advisory group)
  * Meet-ups
  * How might we make this possible for those who are not as privileged? -- great point.
