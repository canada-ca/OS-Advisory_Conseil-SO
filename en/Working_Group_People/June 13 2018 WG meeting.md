  * Open culture/ open decision framework: Richard to push whitepapers to github
* Business case: is it about the business case for people within the governement to use open source or outside companies helping the government?
  * Work with outside vendors for open source solutions, might not have the cpacity to do it within the government. How do we manage change in mentality in the government?

  * Ann: founder of GDPR, privacy by design, product: smart data, competes with Alexia. This can be a part of the business case

  * Break down silos within the government
