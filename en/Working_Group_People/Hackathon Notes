## Hackathon Plan

A hackathon is a one or two day event organized by a department to allow participants to try out new open source technologies, solve new problems and experiment with Open Government approaches.
It is often done off site in order to take the participants out of the headspace of day to day activity.
Food, beverages and snacks are provided for the the duration of the event.

The open source hackathon can be specifically designed to:
* Raise awareness of Open Source Technology within the developer community
* Deepen the relationship between a specific client and their partner departments, and the GoC open source community as a whole
* Discover new open source projects within the GoC
* Raise overall brand awareness & open source innovation leadership at the client organization

I've included a link to a Google Document that summarizes our Digital Hackdays Plan & Execution at the Department of Works and Pensions in the UK on Nov. 24th, 2017, here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nq7TdmjxgN3x1YEDarl2--ccrVfEr9Jq_BwAwYMW8J4/edit?usp=sharing

We also completed a Hackday with the National Health Service in the UK: http://nhshackday.com/events/2017/07/manchester

And a blog summarizing the benefits the NHS realized: https://the-digital-owl.co.uk/2017/07/17/nhs-hack-day-17-manchester/

Based on these approaches we should 1) identify a candidate department to host 2) set a timeline for the event (~3 out) and 3) create a cadence for the hackathon delivery group & create a project plan
