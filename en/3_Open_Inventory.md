# Open Inventory

Welcome to the Open Source Project Inventory. We are trying to understand all
of the open source projects that are taking place across the Government of
Canada. If you are working on a project, please add it to this list. We do not
want to be too prescriptive at this point, so we have not created a controlled
vocabulary for domain, however, this list will help us work towards that.

Please submit your project by pull request, an admin will review and approve.

Thanks!
