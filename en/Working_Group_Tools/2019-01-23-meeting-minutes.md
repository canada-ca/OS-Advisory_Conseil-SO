* Roundtable

## Notes

* Web CMS for Government of Canada
  * Developed a [WXT Drupal distribution](https://www.drupal.org/project/wxt)
  * Lots of questions around Canada.ca
    * Can we have this as a Cloud native option?
    * Is this going to be available as a service for departments?
    * Is there a GC-wide direction decided yet or mandatory?
  * Adam: 
    * What sort of push back did you guys receive?
    * Any private companies pushing back?
    * Are there politics against adoption?
  * Andrew: 
    * Lots of push back was around security but now the realisation is that this was not founded.
    * Core Drupal is stable and this has been a successful use of OSS in multiple projects
  * Joel:
    * Worked on Drupal 5 years before WXT came in.
    * WXT Framework is being used in provincial governments as well.
    * Helped support the company activities (This might be an example of GC supporting Canadian companies)
  * Adam:
    * Might need a GC champion actually pushing an OSS solution as a success story for all other departments
  * Andrew:
    * Links to Cloud Native

### Previous meeting minutes initiative.

* Solutions can now mostly be offered as a SaaS
  * Adam:
    * This is a solid candidate for the OSAB to provide as a success story and make the case for OSS.
  * Andrew:
    * Cloud native architecture is already prepared
    * Presentations could be designed in a relatively short term
  * Adam:
    * Rules WG might be interested to learn about all the steps that were required.
    * How do you procure it?
  * Joel:
    * Can support in the presentations
    * Procurement: typically departments don't necessarily have the staff with experience to do it but you can use procurement vehicles
* Cloud Native Architecure:
  * Adam:
    * Cloud Native Computing Foundation work being done at Statistics Canada
    * Will Hearn has been working on containerizing and moving to Cloud a lot of applications (OSS and proprietary)
    * Kubernetes (K8s) is being leveraged to bringing infrastructure to code to enable scaling.
    * Includes .NET projects in the Cloud as well.
* Roundtable
  * Adam: need to figure out the path to success for the OSAB, ways for departments to use OSS. Need impactful stories.
  * Larry: Interested in seeing how automation could support OSS in the GC, increasing pipelines speed.
  * Jim: Great work being done in Statistics Canada and inspiring to see similar activities being done in ESDC.
  * Stuart: CI and pipeline, making progress in ECCC. Slowly using GitLab in teams. Can organize demos. Lots of folks don't know about automation. Might be an opportunity to provide automated standard tasks for these developers.
