Next Steps
* Presentations for departments
  * Statistics Canada - Data Visualization Tools
    * Plan for January OSAB

Reginald from Statistics Canada and [TBC] from ESDC
* Added potential technologies, not specifically prescribing specific tools
* GCmessage on GIS channel leveraged
* Might explore the GCconnex/GCcollab groups to stimulate conversation
* Also have another contact at Agriculture Canada

Will Stevens - Business requirements for Reference Architecture
* List was used in the past to help drive the discussion/research/analysis
* Can be used as a guide for the types of information that we should be revealing when proposing an Architecture.
* Not all points need to be clarified but they provide a solid understanding of what we try to achieve with the architecture.
* Adds context to the Architecture
* [ ] Working group input would be appreciated

Reference Architecture documents structure/Template
* It could be interesting/useful to have blocks of the stack separated by tiers.

Action for Guillaume - Criteria list to assess OSS + Use of Business requirements + Architecture model/Template
