## Discussed Objectives of the Tools Working Group

* The major objective is to educate the Open Source council on the various technologies, architectures, products, and development methodologies.
* The tools working group will not propose what should be the Open Source standards or default products for the Government of Canada.
* We will strive to ensure equitable representation for all Vendors and to obtain feedback from the Government of Canada how best to continue to present the material.
* Each Month we will select one or more members of the working group to focus on one technology stack and will review reference architectures, deployment models, and vendors supporting the specific Open Source products. The selected members will contribute each month to the Government of Canada Open Source business case the content they have prepared to present to the Open Source council.
* The Working group will track and add all content to the GitHub working group folder and will use Rocket Chat for IM / ongoing communication.

## 2018-10-30 Meeting Minutes
### Attendees:
* Will Stevens
* Jim Cowie
* Mike Nguyen
* Reginald Maltais
* Ross Clark
* Janique Godin
* Adam Peck
* Nick Schonning

### Overview from last meeting

* Having presentations around specific technology is out of context for this group. However, having tangible and real life examples will make people understand see how it relates to each other
* Look at past or future projects/concept cases the government of Canada to highlight reference architectures in regards to those solutions
* A pager or 2 pager analysis including business requirements, tech stacks and how it will provide opportunities for the government of Canada to re-use etc.
* What are the deliverables for this working group and where will it be tracked?
  * Fall into the definition and explaining each of the technologies that we will be recommending as a reference architecture like what Janique Godin's team presented at the Open First Day explaining how these different pieces work together, how to reuse them and how they are viable options
  * We will produce a document with recommended reference architecture and it will be tracked in the Open Source Advisory Board Github page under the [Tools section](https://github.com/canada-ca/OS-Advisory_Conseil-SO/tree/master/en/Working_Group_Tools)
  * If you want to help re-structure our [Open Source Advisory Board repository](https://github.com/canada-ca/OS-Advisory_Conseil-SO), please let Guillaume (guillaume.charest@tbs-sct.gc.ca) or Stacey (stacey.williams@tbs-sct.gc.ca) know

### Examples of concept cases/projects to look into
* RFI: Talent Management System - Public Service Commission  
* Data visualization, self-serve capabilities for non-technical users (like a Power BI functionalities for non-CS employees - Statistics Canada
  * Put a challenge out about having a full stack OSS
  * Would want a tableaux like function for data visualization, good way to look into a new project
* Any existing projects that you would like to look into, anything you've seen in the past that you know that would of been a great opportunity for open source software, but that wasn't the case, it was also be valuable to look into
* Stat Can has a project in the idea stage Reginald Maltais and Janique Godin
  * Geospatial from on premise proprietary to cloud and OSS
  * Agriculture, NRcan, Foreign Affairs are wondering about migrating to cloud or OSS
  * Option for Internal vs external use
  * Can see re-use across other departments, showcase how open source tools can be deployed and scaled across departments
* Canadian Safe Food Initiative- CFIA
  * This project is looking for reference architecture
* Do we know what the business objectives are?
* Real Property- Guillaume
  * Web-based reporting
* As an example, Telus has open-sourced their reference architecture here: https://github.com/telus/reference-architecture

### Action items
* Contact business owner of each project and propose the work we want to do for them
* Look at work load for each project
  * Geo-spatial project is big: can be broken down in pieces, create multiple presentations. Janique and Reginald will work on this
  * Choose projects and prioritize them and their tasks
  * Guillaume to reach out to someone from the Public Safety Commission about Talent Management system and Real Property project
* Any reference architecture we produce, it is important that it states the business requirements that we are solving and can be used in a wider context
* Create a project branch for this working group to work off of the Open Source Advisory Board repository or create files under the tools file
* Janique Godin to ask Will for a similar presentation on reference architecture
