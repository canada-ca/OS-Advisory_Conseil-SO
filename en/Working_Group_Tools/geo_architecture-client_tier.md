# Geospatial Systems Reference Architectures - Application Services Tier

Geospatial data consumption and desktop based production and analysis. Both web and desktop clients are candidates for analysis. Web clients are for use by both internal and external clients. Desktop clients will be used by departmental GIS professionals for advanced analysis and data production/maintenance operations.

## Possible Technologies

* [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/)
* [OpenLayers](http://openlayers.org/)
* [QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/)
* [GeoNode](http://geonode.org/)

# Business / Organization Requirements

* Consumes OGC services from the application layer
* Allow download of data in various formats (as much as the app layer can provide)
* Able to combine geospatial data with tabular data
* Provides facilities to create/perform more advanced analysis (can be through libraries/plugins)
* Web interfaces integrate with other systems (WET)
  * Note: WET includes [OpenLayers](http://openlayers.org/), but it is out of date
