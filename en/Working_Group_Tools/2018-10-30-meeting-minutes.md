## Discussion items

### Overview from last meeting

* Having presentations around specific technology is out of context for this group. However, having tangible and real life examples will make people understand see how it relates to each other
* Look at past or future projects/concept cases the government of Canada to highlight reference architectures in regards to those solutions
* A pager or 2 pager analysis including business requirements, tech stacks and how it will provide opportunities for the government of Canada to re-use etc.
* What are the deliverables for this working group and where will it be tracked?
  * Fall into the definition and explaining each of the technologies that we will be recommending as a reference architecture like what Janique Godin's team presented at the Open First Day explaining how these different pieces work together, how to reuse them and how they are viable options
  * We will produce a document with recommended reference architecture and it will be tracked in the Open Source Advisory Board Github page under the [Tools section](https://github.com/canada-ca/OS-Advisory_Conseil-SO/tree/master/en/Working_Group_Tools)
  * If you want to help re-structure our [Open Source Advisory Board repository](https://github.com/canada-ca/OS-Advisory_Conseil-SO), please let Guillaume (guillaume.charest@tbs-sct.gc.ca) or Stacey (stacey.williams@tbs-sct.gc.ca) know

### Examples of concept cases/projects to look into
* RFI: Talent Management System - Public Service Commission
* Data visualization, self-serve capabilities for non-technical users (like a Power BI functionalities for non-CS employees - Statistics Canada
  * Put a challenge out about having a full stack OSS
  * Would want a tableaux like function for data visualization, good way to look into a new project
* Any existing projects that you would like to look into, anything you've seen in the past that you know that would of been a great opportunity for open source software, but that wasn't the case, it was also be valuable to look into
* Stat Can has a project in the idea stage Reginald Maltais and Janique Godin
  * Geospatial from on premise proprietary to cloud and OSS
  * Agriculture, NRCan, Foreign Affairs are wondering about migrating to cloud or OSS
  * Option for Internal vs external use
  * Can see re-use across other departments, showcase how open source tools can be deployed and scaled across departments
  * Possibility to work with ESDC as they have tools already available.
* Canadian Safe Food Initiative- CFIA, Ross Clark
  * This project is looking for reference architecture
    * Application Canadian safe food initiatives
    * Reference architecture, open data stack
* Do we know what the business objectives are?
* Real Property- Guillaume
  * Web-based reporting
* As an example, Telus has open-sourced their reference architecture here: https://github.com/telus/reference-architecture

Subsequent discussion with Reginald and Janique:

## Action Items

* Contact business owner of each project and propose the work we want to do for them
* Look at work load for each project
  * Geo-spatial project is big: can be broken down in pieces, create multiple presentations. Janique and Reginald will work on this
  * Choose projects and prioritize them and their tasks
  * Guillaume to reach out to someone from the Public Safety Commission about Talent Management system and Real Property project
* Any reference architecture we produce, it is important that it states the business requirements that we are solving and can be used in a wider context
  * Also need to explain why area is not covered because of x reason
* Create a project branch for this working group to work off of the Open Source Advisory Board repository or create files under the tools file
* Janique Godin to ask Will for a similar presentation on reference architecture

### Lunch and learn suggestion

* Leveraging Social Media
