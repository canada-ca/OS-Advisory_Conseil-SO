## Notes

Previous meeting minutes 

* Functional and Non-Functional requirements 
  * Compatible with existing pipelines 
  * Source code management, work with what is out there 
  
Comments
* Stakeholders are missing 
* Expectations: devs, managers, dept/GC vision 
* Records management
* Open Resource Exchange : point to it 
  * Seamless collaboration (Bitbucket, gitlab, github: need accounts for each and will need to sync between the platforms, rules around that)
  * Single centralized for source code authority 
* Identity and access management: do you already have identity management that spans across all departments?
  * No, working on it 
  * SSC: Microsoft dynamics, missing some departments
  * My Key
* Discoverability and collaboration of projects: solid understanding of managing who people are
* Offering public acceptability, are you accepting public contribution (i.e. pull request)?
  * Yes 
  * State how you would like people to contribute
  * Not just GC employees, need to identify public contributors
  * Microsoft Open Source portal:  identify Microsoft employees 
    * Active directory structure, linking github profiles of employees 
    * IM management through internal port, 2 factor authentication github
* Tool we choose: need to support different layers 
  * Released but unclassified: can’t be released right away to public but will be in the future. Need an easy switch 
  * Code should be unclassified 
* Is there a requirement to consider groups of people outside of CS category writing script?
  * Look at users, anyone who contributes to the code 
  * Accessibility for everyone: getting git on all computers 
  * Accessibility requirements, official languages 
  * Is the GC key a option?
  * Pressure from people doing day to day short work, quick turn around. GC policy requirements on public visible. Source code is it’s own language (not English or French), language of work needs to be bilingual 
  * Day to day and government policy 
  * Github: support multilingual, is it a problem if the platform can’t support it?
  * The hosted solution needs to be bilingual
