## Notes 

* Guillaume:
  * Meeting with Procurement and Legal
  * Identify all business cases
* Daniel:
  * Identify special groups that need to be able to do certain types of "acquisition"
  * Remove certain of the irritants, document and mitigate the risks internally.
  * Enumerate and clarify what needs to be Enterprise Architecture level and what doesn't.
  * Justification: minimizing risks, whether in procurement itself or in the choice of technology.
  * Option analysis may not be complete: missing information, rapidity of technology evolving.
    * No current mechanisms to go back and change tech stack if industry has evolved faster than our procurement/adoption of solution components has.
  * Alex Benay has been circulating the ITQ AI, OurBrain (?) has been offering open source software but repackaged.
  However, the company that created the open source software has not seen the value in applying, that we know.
* Guillaume: 
  * External communications around use of OSS, and how to bring private companies.
  * Daniel:
    * Discussion with R Studio for the due diligence to work with the GC cost them more than what they expected to do in return.
* Sebastien:
  * Would like to see TBS talk about OSS more, bring in companies.
  * Been working on Guidelines, Open Resources Exchange, directives and basically all things OSS!
  * Last week at TBS!
* Jim:
  * Select an OSS and down the road see that we need support.
  * Can there be complaints if we were to choose a single company for vendors.
  * What would be the proper process.
  * Similar to using a SaaS within amounts allowed for single source provider but then need to scale: what do you do?

## Next steps

* Members to document specific use cases (see above Daniel and Jim's examples)
