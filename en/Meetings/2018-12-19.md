* Question:
  * How do we implement OSS in conservative departments?
    * Going to help new comers through OSAB
    * Engage, communicate and work together
  * How can new projects from the  private sector be engaged with the Government of Canada Github
    * OSAB could be the sponsor to special projects that would be released
  * Source code classification should be unclassified but there would be exceptions
    * In the case of exceptions, algorithms will not be released because of safety, security etc.
  * Namespaces management:
    * needs an organizational structure
    * IAM strategy
  * Organize an internal repository for the Government of Canada to get started
    * Identify a standard repository to get source code in one place
  * Elizabeth: Agree to prioritize but shops around town are not all at the same level.
    * Will need training for everyone
    * Raise awareness
  * Elizabeth: question around on the timing:
    * How are we going to help the departments who do not use or have OSS set up to ensure that they are successful?
  * CSPS Digital Academy will have courses around devops and agile
  * Data and guidelines
  * How far will guidelines reach?
    * I.e. Bilingualism in comments
    * Current position is that comments in code is not to be included in translation
    * Software documentation (e.g.: Readme, Security, installation files) should be bilingual
      * Legal advice requested to confirm scope of law.
        * Is a project considered communication to the public or work language, etc.
    * Propose a quarterly refresh of documentation instead of a daily refresh.
  * Guidelines to reflect future state
    * Version control of data
