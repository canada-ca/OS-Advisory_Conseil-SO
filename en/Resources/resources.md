(EN)[Making source code open and reusable](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/making-source-code-open-and-reusable#making-code-with-a-security-enforcing-function-open) : UK Government Service Manual explaining that creation of new source code *must* be open and what are the requirements related to this practice.

(EN)[Government Digital Services (GDS) Operations open source - Guidelines](http://gds-operations.github.io/guidelines/) : This document describes a set of rules and principles for publishing Open Source code that GDS explicitly intends to support.

(EN)[11 barriers to coding in the open and how to overcome them](https://gdstechnology.blog.gov.uk/2018/11/05/11-barriers-to-coding-in-the-open-and-how-to-overcome-them/) : This is a blog post from Khidr Suleman, GDS team member, that goes over barriers to coding in the open and how to overcome them.

(EN)[Security considerations when coding in the open](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-source-guidance/security-considerations-when-coding-in-the-open) : Great Britain Government guidance document on security considerations for Open Source development.

(EN)[Working with open standards](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/working-with-open-standards) : UK Government Service Manual explaining what Open Standards are and how to use them.

(EN)[Why we use a ‘docs as code’ approach for technical documentation](https://gdstechnology.blog.gov.uk/2017/08/25/why-we-use-a-docs-as-code-approach-for-technical-documentation/) : Blog post from Jen Lambourne, GDS,explaining why they are documenting like their developers are coding. This could be interesting for policy making.

## GitHub

[InnerSource](https://paypal.github.io/InnerSourceCommons/) : Is the concept of Open Source but within a particular department, agency, or a group of similar agencies.  Denis Skinner mentioned there is difficulties in sharing and collaborating on internal projects.  Just last week at GitHub Constellation in London, we had [Lloyd's bank](https://www.computerworlduk.com/devops/lloyds-software-lead-james-mcleod-on-innersourcing-bank-3673828/) talk about their InnerSource journey that has led to building a community of collaboration internally within the bank.

[CapitalOne's Dev Exchange](https://medium.com/capital-one-developers/open-source-in-a-regulated-environment-dc4b4d9af3f8): CapitalOne is a great example of a company who has successfully utilized GitHub for both internal development and external (open) development.

[How Github uses GitHub](https://resources.github.com/webcasts/GitHub-writing-documentation-for-your-projects/): I believe you were interested in this.  Late last year, we did a full series of [webcasts](https://resources.github.com/webcasts/) on this topic. On our [resources](https://resources.github.com/) page, you find additional white papers, and videos.

Finally, Marc asked about secure development.  From the [question](../Meetings/2018-03-15.md) section "Concerning Github, what security measures are in place to prevent mistakes? Two controls: no one can delete and there is a backup in cloud. Many controls like fork and branch to review the code before publishing it."
