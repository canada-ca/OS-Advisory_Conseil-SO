[InnerSource](https://paypal.github.io/InnerSourceCommons/) : Is the concept of Open Source but within a particular department, agency, or a group of similar agencies.  Denis Skinner mentioned there is difficulties in sharing and collaborating on internal projects.  Just last week at GitHub Constellation in London, we had [Lloyd's bank](https://www.computerworlduk.com/devops/lloyds-software-lead-james-mcleod-on-innersourcing-bank-3673828/) talk about their InnerSource journey that has led to building a community of collaboration internally within the bank.

[CapitalOne's Dev Exchange](https://medium.com/capital-one-developers/open-source-in-a-regulated-environment-dc4b4d9af3f8): CapitalOne is a great example of a company who has successfully utilized GitHub for both internal development and external (open) development.

[How Github uses GitHub](https://resources.github.com/webcasts/GitHub-writing-documentation-for-your-projects/): I believe you were interested in this.  Late last year, we did a full series of [webcasts](https://resources.github.com/webcasts/) on this topic. On our [resources](https://resources.github.com/) page, you find additional white papers, and videos.

Finally, Marc asked about secure development.  From the [question](../Meetings/2018-03-15.md) section "Concerning Github, what security measures are in place to prevent mistakes? Two controls: no one can delete and there is a backup in cloud. Many controls like fork and branch to review the code before publishing it."
