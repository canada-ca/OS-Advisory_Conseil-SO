## Topics

### [OSAB recommendation for Digital Standards](../Meetings/2018-07-18.md#digital-standards)

### Discussion

Presentation from last OSAB - [Open Standards and OSS in GC presentation](../Resources/Open_Standards_OSS_GC.md)

#### Open standards

- Open API
  - SDKs should also be open source
  - No licence fees for use
  - Interoperability - API standards

#### Contributing to OSS

- Links with open science, research and innovation (BCIP, NSERC, ..)
- Open by default

#### Using OSS

- Beware of misrepresentation as open source (marketing)
  - Ex.: Saying your Open Source since you software is running on Apache
- OSS should stand on it's own
- open.canada.ca is all OSS
- Avoid Lock-in to software, support/services and infrastructure
- Limit use to software with OSI Popular licences

### Legal
#### GC contributing to OSS
##### In-house code

- Licence
  - Apache licence with patent assurances might be a good choice to encourage corporate contributions
- Copyright
  - Code developped by GC employees during work is covered by Crown Copyright
- Need authority to release process
- Telling vendors to release code as OSS is against TBS policy

##### Upstream OSS

- Copyright
  - Code developped by GC employees during work is covered by Crown Copyright
- Contributor licence agreement (CLA)
  - A majority of projects do not require that you give up the Crown Copyright to contribute.
  - You may have to licence the Crown Copyright under the OSS licence of the project

#### GC OSS projects
##### External contribution
- Copyright
  - Contributors should licence the use of their contributions and related copyright under the OSS licence of the project
