Microsoft presentation
* Announced intention to acquire Github
  * Their team works with Github, learned what does and doesn't work at large
* Small team managing the Open Source iniatiative at Microsoft
* How do we use open source at the beginning
* Teach people how to contribute back to open source: keep up to date with the community as a best practice
* Issues with licensing, copy right, what tools do we need to do that?
* Just over 11 thousand repos on Microsoft, all microsoft employees can see the projects (having conservations in the open)
  * Only accessible to Microsoft employees
* Enable businesses to do what they need, engineers are out customers
* Component registration is mandatory
* Reducing friction: Microsoft doesn't ask if the product is in competition with Microsoft, the answer is always yes.
  * Eliminating rules was helpful
* Up to the team to decide what open source products that they want to use
* What considerations went into the decision to use the MIT licence?
  * Patent concerns
  * MIT doesn't have to assign copyright to microsoft, everyone owns their copyright
  * More collaborative
* Government lens: this relates to licensing, points about automation and business rules that need to be followed
