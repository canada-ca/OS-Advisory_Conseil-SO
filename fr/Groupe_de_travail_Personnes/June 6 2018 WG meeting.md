### Meeting Notes

#### Align with TBS roadmap
* Whitepaper: please read it and provide Guillaume with your feedback. 
  * This is to help business understand where the value is in open souce 

#### Working Group road map
* Vern tasked the working groups to create a workplan for the next Open Source Advisory Board meeting, June 20. 
* We need to pick key milestones for this year for this working group. 
  * Possible key milestones this year are to increase awareness of open source and it's value, build skills in open source tools and dev/ops and get non-technical individuals engaged in open source methodology(community engagement)
* To achieve our objectives we need to address silos in the government, look into public/private relationships and re-use what others have already done
* To meet timelines, we need to start with quick wins. I.e. we should pick a project that is visible like the password renewal or another troubled application to show how the community effort made it transparent and successful. This will be usefl in the business case to show the quantifiable savings for using open source and how it benefitted the government of Canada and citizens.
  * Another example is how in the government we have multiple applications that have the same functionality so we could reach out to the developers to see if they can colloborate. Alternatively, we can set up a parrallel platform to a troubled application and show how the community can come together to tackle the issues
  * Example: the travel application that we have in the Government of Canada: show and talk about it how it works when you talk to users
* Idea of co-working/co-location: is there the ability to get people working alone to come out to development shops and expose them to different ways of working.
* Open Source Day: aiming for it to be decentralized, bilingual, business and tech driven. We can bring ideas for this day to this working group.
* What is the main issues that we are trying to solve?
  * From the business side, do they not want to do open source, is there a misunderstanding of open source is or is guidance necessary?
    * It is a mix of all of these things. In the government of Canada, our procurement has been focused on closed source products. There needs to be further education about the business value of Open Source, our open source day in September will help this. 

 #### Tools
  * GitHub
  * GCcollab
    * Join the GCCollab group: CTO Open Source Advisory Board to be able to colloborate. Guillaume will send out the invite link. 
    * Working draft will be posted on GCcollab and then the bilingual material will be posted to Github 
    * Harsh to send Guillaume the learning toolkit/box 

  
#### Structure of Github for this group
* Items that fall under objectives are more like principles.
* Set up pages for principles, Objectives and workplan on Github

* Recurring meeting (biweekly)
  * We will create weekly meetings for the month of June and then in July we will move to bi-weekly meetings. 
  * Action items for next week's meetin
      * We will meet with a revised workplan with objectives
      * Finalize out workplan for the OSAB presentation June 20
      * Contribute to the business case: xamples of success stories, key words and reuse as much as possible from the whitepaper
      * Github works in the open through issues and pull requests. They colloborate together openly, nothing is behind closed doors. Harsh to find a public example of this
      * Christopher Allison to talk to Harsh about the Open ID connect
* Organizational culture: How to pull this all together, are we going to put money behind it or get our group to leverage people. This needs to be of value to you and your organization

* Task teams
